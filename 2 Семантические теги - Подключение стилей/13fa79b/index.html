        <p>I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious
            reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands
            everything,
            even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs
            cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this
            grown-up
            grew. All grown-ups were once chil5dren - although few of them remember it. And so I correct my
            dedication:</p>

        <h2>I</h2>
        <p>Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, <span class="itallic">called True Stories from Nature</span>,
            about
            the
            primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of
            the
            drawing.</p>
        <img src="images/hroznys.jpg" alt="">
        <p>In the book it said: <span class="itallic">"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not
            able
            to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."</span></p>
        <p>I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I
            succeeded
            in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:</p>
        <img src="images/klobouk.jpg" alt="">
        <p>I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.</p>
        <p>But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"</p>
        <img src="images/slon.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether
            from
            the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is
            why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been
            disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand
            anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to
            them.</p>


        <p class="itallic">"That is a hat."</p>
        <p>Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring
            myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the
            grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.</p>

        <h2>II</h2>

        <p>The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more
            isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement,
            at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:</p>
        <p>"If you please--draw me a sheep!"</p>
        <p>What!"</p>
        <p>"Draw me a sheep!"</p>

        <img src="images/malyPrinc.jpg" alt="">
        <p>That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old,
            and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.</p>

        <p>"But--what are you doing here?"</p>
        <p>And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence:</p>
        <p>"If you please--draw me a sheep..."</p>

        <p>"That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep..."</p>
        <p>But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of
            the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with:</p>

        <p>So then I made a drawing.</p>
        <img src="images/nemocnyBeranek.jpg" alt="">
        <p>He looked at it carefully, then he said:</p>
        <p>"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."</p>
        <p>So I made another drawing.</p>
        <img src="images/Beran.jpg" alt="">
        <p>My friend smiled gently and indulgently.</p>
        <p>"You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns."</p>
        <p>So then I did my drawing over once more.</p>
        <p>But it was rejected too, just like the others.</p>
        <img src="images/staryBeranek.jpg" alt="">
        <p>By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed
            off this drawing.</p>
        <img src="images/krabice.jpg" alt="">
        <p>And I threw out an explanation with it.</p>
        <p>"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."</p>
        <p>"Why?"</p>
        <p>"Because where I live everything is very small..."</p>
        <p>"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very small sheep that I have given you."</p>

        <h2>III</h2>

        <p>The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too
            complicated for me), he asked me:</p>
        <img src="images/princSala.jpg" alt="">
        <p>"What is that object?"</p>
        <p>"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane."</p>
        <p>And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.</p>
        <p>He cried out, then:</p>
        <p>"What! You dropped down from the sky?"</p>
        <p>"Yes," I answered, modestly.</p>
        <p>Then he added:</p>
        <p>"So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"</p>
        <p>But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:</p>
        <img src="images/malyPrincHvezdy.jpg" alt="">
        <p>"Tie him! What a queer idea!"</p>
        <p>"But if you don't tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, and get lost."</p>
        <p>And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added:</p>
        <p>"Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far..."</p>
